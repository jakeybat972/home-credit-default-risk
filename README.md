# Predicting Loan Default Risk

## Business Problem
Financial institutions must balance loan growth with credit risk. Approving high-risk applicants leads to costly defaults, while rejecting low-risk applicants results in lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction. This project builds predictive models to estimate loan default probability and evaluates how decision thresholds impact portfolio risk and profitability.

## Data
This project uses the Home Credit Default Risk dataset from Kaggle, which includes demographic, financial, and historical credit information for loan applicants. The dataset reflects real-world challenges such as missing data, class imbalance, and heterogeneous feature types.

## Approach
- Exploratory data analysis to understand applicant characteristics and default patterns
- Feature engineering to capture credit risk signals
- Baseline and advanced predictive models
- Cost-sensitive threshold optimization to align model decisions with business objectives
- Model interpretability analysis
