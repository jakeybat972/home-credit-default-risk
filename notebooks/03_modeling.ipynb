    "- Establishing a strong, interpretable baseline using logistic regression\n",
    "- Comparing feature sets to assess the incremental value of engineered features\n",
    "- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics for imbalanced data\n",
    "- Prioritizing robustness and stability over marginal performance gains"
